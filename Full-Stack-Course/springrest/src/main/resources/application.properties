#Hibernate JPA properties-----hese properties affect the behavior of your Spring Boot application's 
#interaction with the database, specifically when using JPA and Hibernate. They can have a significant 
#impact on database schema updates, query generation, and performance. Therefore, it's important to understand their
# implications and adjust them according to your development and production needs.
spring.jpa.show-sql = true  
#This property determines whether to log the SQL statements generated by Hibernate
#When set to true, Hibernate's SQL queries will be printed in the application logs.
# This can be helpful for debugging and understanding the queries being executed.

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update
#With ddl-auto set to update, when you add a new field or update an existing 
#field in your Course entity, Hibernate will generate SQL to modify the database schema accordingly.

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
#This property specifies the SQL dialect to be used by Hibernate. 
#The dialect determines how Hibernate translates its HQL (Hibernate Query Language) queries to the actual 
#SQL statements for the underlying database. In your case, it's set to the MySQL 8 dialect.
